Mini Metro is a simple looking game in which you have to plan out a metro system with limited resources. As the game progresses, you get more an more stations that you need to connect, and more and more passengers which you have to account for.
The stations are indicated by various shapes, starting with circles, squares, and triangles. Each station will pop up riders indicated via the same shapes. A circle rider wants to get to a circle station, so based on how you set up your lines, it will take the appropriate train to get there.This gets more and more complicated as the stations invariably do not line up nicely, cluster multiple of the same station type together, randomly puts one station way out in BFE, and your poorly thought out lines look more and more like spaghetti.
There are many different levels which you'll unlock by doing well in prior levels. Each with their own challenges, like some cities have a lot of waterways and your limited number of tunnels or bridges available will make it a mad scramble just to keep things going. As more and more passengers get added, the possibility of any one station overcrowding is something you have to manage, either by adding new lines, more cars to your train, additional trains, or building an interchange which will speed up the loading of passengers.
The game runs on a weekly cycle, and at the end of every week, you'll get two options to pick between of these kinds of options.
Lots of times, I found myself moving trains and readjusting lines to alleviate problem areas just to live to see the weekend and possibly get saved by an extra rail line.
Overall, I've enjoyed it. It's kind of a soothing game to play. As there's no endgame, per se, I once again have to set my own parameters. I unlocked all the available levels, and that was enough for me. I came, I played, I got my $1 worth.
Onto the next thing.
