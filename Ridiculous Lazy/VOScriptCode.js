var script = "STEM. SCIENCE... TECHNOLOGY... ENGINEERING... AND MATH. THESE ARE THE JOBS OF TOMORROW... WHICH PRESENTS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR TODAY. HOW CAN WE BETTER PREPARE YOUTH FOR THESE CAREERS? THE ANSWER IS ESPECIALLY PRESSING FOR FEMALES AND MINORITIES... WHO ARE CONSISTENTLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN STEM FIELDS AND OTHER PROMISING CAREERS. THAT'S WHERE THE IMEDIA FOUNDATION STEPS IN. DEDICATED TO UTILIZING THE DEMOCRATIC CAPABILITIES OF TECHNOLOGY AND EDUCATION... IMEDIA BELIEVES IT IS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES WITH AN APPROACH THAT REFLECTS THE REALITIES OF OUR DIGITAL AGE...AN AGE WHERE THE 'REAL WORLD' IS NO FURTHER THAN THE HANDHELD SCREEN OF YOUR CELL PHONE. THROUGH INTERACTIVE ONLINE PLATFORMS... IMEDIA FOUNDATION WILL REACH OUT TO YOUTH ACROSS THE NATION... OFFERING EQUAL ACCESS TO INFORMATIVE AND ENGAGING ACTIVITIES. THE GOAL? TO PREPARE STUDENTS TO ENTER STEM FIELDS IN AN INCREASINGLY GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE WORKFORCE. THE U.S. IS CURRENTLY FACING BOTH NATIONAL AND GLOBAL ISSUES OF PARTICIPATION. THAT'S WHY IT IS CRUCIAL NOW... MORE THAN EVER... THAT WE ENSURE THE FUTURE OF THE NATION IS IN THE PALMS OF AN INCLUSIVE AND INFORMED GENERATION. TOGETHER WITH ITS PARTNERS... IMEDIA ACCEPTS THIS CHALLENGE AND LOOKS FORWARD TO DIRECTING THE INNOVATIONS AND UNPRECEDENTED RESOURCES OF TODAY TOWARD SOLUTIONS FOR TOMORROW."
