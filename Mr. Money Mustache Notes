Your savings rate as a percentage of your take home pay

How much you take home each year
How much you can live on

As soon as this income is enough to pay for your living expenses, while leaving enough of the gains invested each year to keep up with inflation, you are ready to retire.

Assumptions:
You can earn 5% investment returns after inflation during your saving years
You’ll live off of the  “4% safe withdrawal rate” after retirement, with some flexibility in your spending during recessions.
You want your ‘Stash to last forever, you’ll only be touching the gains, since this income may be sustaining you for seventy years or so. Just think of this assumption as a nice generous Safety Margin.

The Safe Withdrawal Rate is the maximum rate at which you can spend your retirement savings, such that you don’t run out in your lifetime.
just take your annual spending level, and multiply it by 25. That’s how much you need to retire, at the most.
In other words, get your expenses down to $25k (per year), and you can quit your job on $500k or less.

2016: 47K (Dining 3.5k (half), 5k student loans, 1k 401k loss = 39K)
2017: 52K (Dining 4k (half), VO 1.25k, = 48k)

You invest it. In stock index funds, in paying off your own house, in rental houses if you are interested in local real estate, and in other sources as you continue to learn about making money work for you.
