Day 1: Review Udemy options, Marketing course and Web Dev Wordpress site especially. Investigate what Woo is.
Day 2: Was building the track for 9 hours. Progress may or may not happen tonight. I'll try.
Day 3: Stayed awake until 4 so naps were a heavy part of the day + a Travel Team meeting and practice. Tomorrow needs to be a Wordpress focus day.
Day 4: Actually did some stuff. Worked on the intro screen for Clash Tracks. Using an old Gamkedo game Thopiax as a jumping off point in how to best do it. Still a WIP, but trying to get comfortable having things not done yet, but doesn't break anything. lol
Day 5: Messing with intro.js fade in. Found how to get it to show at the beginning. Got the fade in to work using setInterval. Feels a little hacky.
Day 6: Today was kind of a wash. I got derailed by some mind monopolizing news. I did look into how to use the tint function and looked at the smokescreen code that was added. Quite cool.
placeholder for tonight
