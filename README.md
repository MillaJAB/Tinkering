Day 1: Review Udemy options, Marketing course and Web Dev Wordpress site especially. Investigate what Woo is.
Day 2: Was building the track for 9 hours. Progress may or may not happen tonight. I'll try.
Day 3: Stayed awake until 4 so naps were a heavy part of the day + a Travel Team meeting and practice. Tomorrow needs to be a Wordpress focus day.
Day 4: Actually did some stuff. Worked on the intro screen for Clash Tracks. Using an old Gamkedo game Thopiax as a jumping off point in how to best do it. Still a WIP, but trying to get comfortable having things not done yet, but doesn't break anything. lol
